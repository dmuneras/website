## [A New Way to Error Handling üö©](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)

[A recent **Request for Comments (RFC)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384) from the magical **Ember Data** Land takes us on a journey through **error handling** in Ember: It proposes the addition of new error handling methods which do not affect the state of your data records to the [`DS.Errors`](https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember-data/release/classes/DS.Errors) class.

Read more about the new, proposed API and the motivation behind it [in the original proposal and feel free to discuss](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/384)!

## [Using Relationships Links or Not? Your Call! üîó](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387)

Fetching your data from a [JSON:API compliant](https://jsonapi.org/) backend? Not sure how to tell Ember Data **explicitly** to look up an included **relationship** in the payload itself vs. via an additional request using the response's `link` attribute?

Possibly, this will be much easier very soon! [Another new, Ember Data related RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387) proposed the addition of a `shouldFindViaLink` method to the public API of REST **adapters**. According to the proposal, users may overwrite this method - which should return a _Boolean_ to indicate if Ember Data should look up relationship data via links or not - themselves for custom behavior and gain full control of their relational data loading.

You can **read more** about the design of this proposed API [**in the RFC itself**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/387)!

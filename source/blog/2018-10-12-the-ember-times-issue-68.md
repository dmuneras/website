## [Module Unification is in the final stretch!](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)
Have you heard of **Ember's future default project layout**? If you haven't, you can read about it the [Module Unification RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md). 

The initial work on Module Unification is **nearly complete**, as **[there are only a handful of tasks left](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373)** and some of the tasks just need a good amount of spelunking time.
If you can donate some of your time to help finish this up, the entire community will forever be in your debt üíñ

Also, if you are a user of namespaced components, [this RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) is a must read. Please leave your thoughts on the [Module Unification Packages RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/367) as nested components affect the majority of Ember projects.

To learn more about Module Unification, feel free to join the #st-module-unification channel on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS)!

Curious what a real project looks like with module unifcation? Checkout [emberclear](https://emberclear.io) by [@NullVoxPopuli](http://github.com/nullvoxPopuli/) on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/NullVoxPopuli/emberclear/tree/master/packages/frontend) or [github](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/emberclear/tree/master/packages/frontend)!
